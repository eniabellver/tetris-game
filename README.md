# ðŸ•¹ JavaScript Tetris ðŸŽ®

*This is a work in progress and is currently on hold.*

### ðŸŽ² Motivation

In December 2021, I had been learning JavaScript for about two months and wanted to further cement that knowledge during my holiday break. I decided to build a game because it would require a lot of logic. Tetris is an awesome game and I thought using the HTML canvas tag I would be able to make it. It's vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS, no frameworks, only a few dependencies.

It didn't take me long to discover that the JavaScript file would be **gigantic** unless I used modules, my mentor helped me implement Webpack and thanks to this project I gained a deeper understanding of it. Even though the development of this project is on hold, I am attached to the code and want to finish it. I think it will be good to come back to it in the future and write documentation, debug, and make the game playable.
